11-27-09 v1.0.1
Applied fix for SPG_PopThickness.  Thanks to Laurent Desnogues!

8-22-09
Added SPG_LinkedVersion and SPG_Probe for checking the compiled options.

11-8-08 v1.0.0
Changed SPG_Fader and SPG_AlphaFader to SPG_FadedPalette32 and SPG_FadedPalette32Alpha and to use Uint32 instead of RGB.  Changed SPG_SetupRainbowPalette to SPG_RainbowPalette32 and SPG_SetupBWPalette to SPG_GrayPalette32.  Replaced SPG_CopyPoints with SPG_BufferPoints.  They duplicate functionality and I should encourage buffering rather than dynamic stuff.  Added SPG_USE_FAST_MATH (used in SPG_rotation.c).  Updated docs.

11-6-08
Added SPG_ColorPalette, SPG_GrayPalette, SPG_FindPaletteColor, and SPG_PalettizeSurface.  Implemented SPG_CreateSurface8 and SPG_CreateSurface16.  Changed surface creation function names a little.  Changed 32-bit palette stuff to use SDL_PixelFormat.

10-25-08
Changed SPG_TransformSurface to SPG_TransformX.  Added SPG_DirtyAddTo.  Changed SPG_ConvertRGB to SPG_ConvertColor.  Removed transform stack in favor of flags.  Added SPG_BufferPoints.  Added more PI.  Added SPG_TSLOW, but it remains unimplemented.  Renamed internal functions to follow a nice naming scheme.  Added SPG_EnableRadians.  Updated docs.

9-29-08 Prerelease of v1.0.0
Big, new release.

9-27-08
Added thick line primitives.  The alpha and anti-aliased ones still need special handling.  Fixed div-by-zero problems in Trigon and Quad fns.

9-22-08
Changed SPG_FadedLine to Uint32 instead of RGB...  But this function is not exported.  Finished implementing dirty rect API.

9-21-08
Added Dirty Rect API.  There might be some tweaks to come.  The primitives still need to output the dirty rects.

9-17-08
Added Get/Set color components.

9-16-08
Changed polygons to use SPG_Point and added polygon transform functions (rotate, scale, skew, translate).  Added SPG_Point versions of all trigon fns and SPG_QuadTex.

7-16-08
Added SPG_REPLACE_COLORKEY blit mode and function SPG_ReplaceColorkey().

7-13-08
Put in a fix for the missing edge problem that SPG_TransformSurface has.  This fix was reverted...  I think accuracy is traded for speed.

7-7-08 v0.941
Fixed the pointy circle problem that affected circles and filled arcs.  Defined SPG_bool as Uint8 since there's no difference in memory.

7-6-08
Combined C and C++ inlines, changed all source files to .c to reflect full compatibility.  Changed some int parameters to SDL ints.

7-5-08
Fixed SPG_ArcFilledBlend and SPG_RectRoundFilledBlend.  Changed variable names of SPG_Bezier to actually make sense.  Changed MAX_ERRORS to SPG_MAX_ERRORS and moved to sprig.h.  Changed SPG_GetLock to return an SPG_bool.  Changed SPG_Error to push to the back of the stack (queue).

6-18-08 v0.94
Fixed SPG_ArcFn.  Changed SPG_LineH (and _HLine) parameters from XXY to XYX.  Changed headers to use lowercase file names.  Added Pi variations to sprig.h.  Large overhaul to build on GNU C.

6-14-08
Added SPG_extended.cpp to the project.  This frees up the standard dll from having to hold less useful functions.  Hacked SPG_CircleFilledBlendAA and SPG_EllipseFilledBlendAA.  Added SPG_Point structure and SPG_MakePoint.

5-30-08
Added working version of SPG_FloodFill8.  Hacked SPG_TrigonFilledAA and SPG_TrigonFilledBlendAA.

4-25-08
Added SPG_GetClip, SPG_RectAND, and SPG_RectOR.  Fixed SPG_RestoreClip and SPG_SetClip.

1-22-08
Changed SPG_Blit to use a function pointer.  Added SPG_SetBlit and SPG_GetBlit.

1-21-08
Changed blend states, AA states, surface alpha states, and errors over to very nice linked-list-based stacks.  Added SPG_GetBlend, SPG_GetAA, and SPG_GetSurfaceAlpha.

1-20-08
Added SPG_Error, SPG_GetError, SPG_NumErrors, and SPG_DisplayFormat.  Fixed SPG_AlphaFader.  Added standard error calls, changed Polygon return values to void.  Fixed triangles not drawing at certain angles.

1-19-08
Fixed SPG_TCOLORKEY stuff.  Added colorkey to SPG_BlendBlit.  Added SPG_ArcFn, SPG_Arc, SPG_ArcBlend, SPG_Polygon, SPG_PolygonBlend, SPG_RectRound, SPG_RectRoundBlend, SPG_RectRoundFilled, SPG_RectRoundFilledBlend (needs filled arc to work right).

1-16-08 v0.93
Fixed SPG_LineFadeFn, _AAmcLineAlpha (LineFadeAABlend), SPG_LineFadeBlend, _PolygonFadeAA, and SPG_PolygonFadeBlend.
Added SPG_TCOLORKEY: Thanks to Dani Gonz�lez!

1-14-08
Removed SPG_LineFade (redundant) and renamed the LineMulti calls as LineFade.

1-8-08 v0.92
Added SPG_sqrt to replace slow sqrt calls.  Changed all primitives over to state-based anti-aliasing.

1-5-08 v0.91
Fixed the rotate calls, but the SPG_TAA flag isn't working right.

12-22-07
Polygons can now be drawn with negative coordinates.  Special thanks to Huge for this contribution!
